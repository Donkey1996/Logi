This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a fresh Git repository named "Logi" owned by Jerry Li, currently containing only a LICENSE file. The repository appears to be in its initial state with no source code, build configuration, or development setup yet established.

## Current State

- **License**: MIT License
- **Structure**: Empty repository with only LICENSE file
- **No build system**: No package.json, Cargo.toml, or other build configuration files found
- **No source code**: No application code or tests present
- **No documentation**: No README or other documentation files

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, the development setup will depend on what type of project is intended to be built here. Common next steps would typically include:

- Adding a README.md to describe the project
- Setting up a build system (package.json for Node.js, Cargo.toml for Rust, etc.)
- Creating initial source code structure
- Configuring development tools and scripts

## Notes for Future Development

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to include:
- Build and test commands specific to the chosen technology stack
- Project architecture and key components
- Development workflow and conventions
